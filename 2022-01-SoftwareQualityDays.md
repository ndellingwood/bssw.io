High software and systems quality are success-critical factors in engineering practices and refer to product, process, and service quality. However, quality attributes have to be embodied within individual phases of software and systems development. In distributed engineering environments, for example, various stakeholders coming from heterogeneous disciplines have to collaborate and interact efficiently. Additional quality attributes with focus on collaboration and data exchange might then apply. Mobile environments, to name another example, typically refer to product quality and include quality requirements regarding usability, interaction, safety, and security. Emerging trends in the area of Artificial Intelligence (AI) can, on the other side, focus on different quality aspects such as (a) how to embody and assure quality in AI applications or (b) how to use AI in context of quality assurance activities such as testing. The 11th edition of the scientific program at the SWQD will aim at exploring the various future perspectives and contemporary challenges in Software Engineering Quality with and for AI.

Following this guiding topic, the conference welcomes contributions related to all topics about software and systems quality. Topics of particular interest – if not limited to – are meant to foster discussions on experiences and challenges of constructive and analytical quality assurance of AI-based systems as well as using AI-based approaches for quality assurance activities.
