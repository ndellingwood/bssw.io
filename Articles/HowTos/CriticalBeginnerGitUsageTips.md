# Critical Beginner Git Usage Tips

<!-- deck text start -->
Getting started with Git can be hard and you can create big problems for yourself and others on your projects if you don't know some of the basics.
This short article provides some critical usage guidelines/tips for Git beginners.
If you follows these guidelines, you will usually stay out of serious trouble and can almost always recover an earlier state.

### Set up minimal global settings right away on every new computer</big> [[minimal_setup](#minimal_setup)]

Always set up a consistent global Git `user.name` and `user.email` on every machine where you use Git right away.
(Otherwise you will show up as many different developers according to Git, and it is a pain to resolve these in all of the Git repos you commit to after the fact).
Also, disable push of all branches by default (prior to Git 2.0) or a simple `git push` will push all branches.
In addition, it is nice to see Git output with color (default is no color).
And, to avoid having to resolve the same merge conflicts multiple times, turn on the `git rerere` feature.
To set these on a new machine, run:

```
$ git config --global user.name "First M. Last"          # CRITICAL
$ git config --global user.email "youremail@someurl.com" # CRITICAL
$ git config --global color.ui true        # Use color in git output to terminal.
$ git config --global push.default simple  # Or 'tracking' with older versions of git.
$ git config --global rerere.enabled 1     # Auto-resolve same conflicts on rebase.
```

Also consider setting up your bash shell prompt and `git` command-completion by downloading the bash scripts [git-prompt.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh) and [git-completion.bash](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash) and add activating them by adding them to your `~/.bash_profile` file with the lines:

``` 
source ~/git-prompt.sh
source ~/git-completion.bash
PS1='[\u@\h \W$(__git_ps1 " (%s)")]\$ '
```

These bash scripts make using Git on the command-line much easier and more productive.

### Create proper logical commits and commit messages [[logical_commits](#logical_commits)]

Creating good commits with good commit messages is important for many reasons.
Commits should contain a single logical change (see "SEPARATE CHANGES" in [gitworkows(7)](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitworkflows.html) and "One Commit per Logical Change Solution" in the [Udacity Git course](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123)).
Commit messages should have a short summary line (under 50 chars is the target) and an optional longer body separated by a blank line (see guidelines in [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)).
For example:

```
Summary line for changes (50 chars is target but a little longer okay)

More detailed explanatory text in the body (wrapped to about 72 chars).
The blank line separating the summary from the body is critical to make
commands like 'git log --oneline', 'git rebase -i', and others readable
and useful.

If you use an issue tracker, put references to them like:

Resolves: #123
Also see: #456, #789
```
<a name="checkpoint_commits_rebase_i"/>

###  Create small local "checkpoint" commits then cleanup with 'git rebase -i' [[checkpoint_commits_rebase_i](#checkpoint_commits_rebase_i)]

To provide for easy local "undos" and better organization of changes into final change-sets, commit often locally using "checkpoint" commits (convention is to use commit summary lines starting with "WIP:").
But before pushing these commits to a remote shared branch, use [`git rebase -i @{u}`](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history#git-rebase-i) to clean up and reorganize the commits into good "logical" commits (see "SEPARATE CHANGES" above).

<a name="commit_before_modifying_ops"/>

### Create local commits for local changes before running any commands that might modify/overwrite uncommitted changes [[commit_before_modifying_ops](#commit_before_modifying_ops)]

The commands `git pull`, `git merge`, `git rebase`, or other Git operations can alter (or
delete) your local uncommitted changes, either in the working directory or the staging
area/index.
So always create (sometimes temporary) commits for these before running any of these commands (unless you want to throw away uncommitted changes in your local repo, for example with `git checkout`, `git reset`, `git clean`, etc.).

<a name="backup_local_branches"/>

### Back up local branches every few hours of work by pushing them to some remote Git repo on a remote machine [[backup_local_branches](#backup_local_branches)]

This is to safeguard your work in case your local machine or disk goes out or your local `.git/` directory becomes corrupted somehow.
(Local Git branches are better than Git stashes because you can back them up to other repos in a version controlled way.
You can’t do that with Git stashes.)

<a name="recover_earlier_state"/>

### You can always recover an earlier state of any of your local branches [[recover_earlier_state](#recover_earlier_state)]

To recover an earlier state , run [`git reflog`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Maintenance-and-Data-Recovery) and then use a combination [`git checkout`](http://marklodato.github.io/visual-git-guide/index-en.html#checkout) and/or [`git reset –hard`](http://marklodato.github.io/visual-git-guide/index-en.html#reset), etc.
(See [How to undo (almost) anything in Git](https://github.blog/2015-06-08-how-to-undo-almost-anything-with-git/#redo-after-undo-local).)

<a name="never_delete_local_repo"/>

### Never delete a local Git repo (unless you are completely done with it) [[never_delete_local_repo](#never_delete_local_repo)]

Your local Git repos have a [wealth of information that can’t be pushed to other Git repos](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~davide/howto/git_lose.html) (e.g. `git rerere` info, `git reflog` info, etc.).
Because of [[recover_earlier_state](#recover_earlier_state)], you should never have to delete a local Git repo and re-clone to get out of some "bad" state.
Only a corrupted disk that corrupts the local Git DB history (which is extremely rare) should cause you to have to re-clone the local Git repo.
(If you feel like you need to delete your local Git repo to get out of some bad state of a non-corrupted repo, then you have not yet learned the basics of Git well enough so keep learning!)

<a name="dont_commit_big_generated_files"/>

### Don’t commit large generated (binary) files in a Git repo [[dont_commit_big_generated_files](#dont_commit_big_generated_files)]

Big generated (binary) files committed to a git repo get stuck in the Git history **forever** and can only be removed by "[filtering](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History)" the Git repo (which is a very disruptive process for everyone involved).

<a name="never_force_push"/>

### Never do `git push -f` to a remote branch shared with other people [[never_force_push](#never_force_push)]

Never force push to a shared branch unless everyone involved really knows what they are doing.  Very few Git users know how to adjust to a forced reset remote branch or even what that means.
(However, if everyone involved knows how to adjust with a forced pushed reset branch to a (temp) shared branch, then force pushes are fine.)

There are many other helpful guidelines that you can come up with for using Git but the ones above are arguably the most helpful for Git beginners (and some people that have been using Git for many years but never learned these basic guidelines).
