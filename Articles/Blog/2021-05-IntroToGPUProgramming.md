As GPU-accelerated systems become increasingly common in the HPC world, the challenge for
domain scientists is to update their computational codes to take full advantage of these new
architectures. This blog post provides a high-level introduction to the main considerations for
GPU programming, and is intended for the reader unfamiliar with the subject matter.

### The “end” of Moore’s law
Until the mid-2000s, the computing capability of microprocessors enjoyed an impressive growth
that was explained by the observation that the number of transistors on a processor chip
doubled roughly every 18 months (Moore’s law<sup>[1]</sup>) while the power consumption remained
constant (Dennard scaling<sup>[2]</sup>). This meant that it was possible to produce faster processors, i.e.
processors with higher clock speeds, by increasing the transistor count without observing a
corresponding rise in the energy required to operate them. Around 2003-2004, CPUs
performance started to flatten<sup>[3]</sup>. As chips became denser with tinier transistors running at higher
clock speeds, heat dissipation turned into an issue and energy usage began to grow
dramatically. Seeing that these obstacles made it difficult to achieve ever higher clock speeds,
the focus shifted towards designing multicore chips capable of processing tasks in parallel.
Thus, the performance gain, as measured by the number of instructions per clock cycle, was
achieved by raising the processor core count to enable parallelism instead of enhancing the
computing power of the individual core.

### Why GPUs?
In recent years, the need to deliver exascale computing capability and the emergence of
data-intensive applications such as AI in the form of machine learning prompted the adoption of
hardware accelerators<sup>[4]</sup> to further increase computing performance beyond what multicore
technology can deliver. An accelerator is any piece of specialized hardware capable of
performing certain functions more efficiently than general-purpose processors, and it is used to
complement the CPU with the goal of increasing throughput. Of particular interest for scientific
computing are the Graphic Processor Unit (GPU) accelerators. While CPUs excel at performing
a wide variety of tasks efficiently, they are capable of executing only a few threads in parallel. In
contrast, GPUs are specialized in data processing tasks and designed with thousands of
processing cores to enable massive parallelism. Thus, they are particularly suited for
highly-parallel and repetitive computing tasks often found in scientific applications. Currently, six
of the ten fastest supercomputers in the world are GPU-accelerated systems<sup>[5]</sup>, and more are
going to be deployed in the near future based on accelerators from Intel, AMD, and Nvidia.

### Host vs device
On GPU-enabled systems, a heterogeneous programming model leveraging both CPU and
GPU is typically used. In this model, the CPU and its memory are referred to as the host, and
the GPU and its memory as the device. Typically, the host can run only a limited number of
concurrent threads, whereas the device can handle thousands of them. As a result, the device
is best suited for calculations that are parallel in nature, where the same operation can be
performed on a large number of data elements at the same time. It follows that code run on the
host commonly executes general-purpose tasks, including memory management for both the
host and the device, and offloads computationally intensive operations to the device by
launching specialized functions known as kernels. GPU kernel launches incur a considerable
overhead compared to CPU function calls and therefore, their use is appropriate when
performing heavy computations. For this reason, it is often best for performance to combine two
or more small computational kernels into a single GPU kernel (kernel fusion) when possible.

### Data transfers between host and device
Because host and device have their own separate memory, transfers of data between the two
are often necessary. However, such transfers are relatively slow compared to the speed at
which GPUs can perform calculations. To this end, it is beneficial to structure the algorithm in
such a way that minimizes transferring data between the host and the device as much as
possible. When data exchange is unavoidable, few large transfers should be preferred over
many small ones in order to limit the cumulative effect of the overhead associated with each
transfer, even at the cost of packing/unpacking non-contiguous chunks of data into send/receive
buffers. Additionally, the impact of data communications should be further mitigated by
overlapping kernel execution with data transfers whenever possible.

Another consideration is whether to explicitly manage host to device transfers or to rely on
abstractions such as CUDA's Unified Virtual Memory (UVM) or Intel's Unified Shared Memory
(USM). These capabilities present host and device memory together using a single address
space, managing data motion under the hood. This allows developers to think of host and
device memory spaces as logically one. The downsides are that application developers have
less control over data motion, and that the page-fault detection mechanism used to develop
these features introduces some overhead. However, these trade-offs may be worth the ease of
development that comes with not having to explicitly manage data transfers.

### Total memory footprint
Data copied to the device should be kept there for as long as possible by allowing multiple
kernels to perform successive calculations on the data before copying it back to the host. Even
if some of these calculations do not parallelize well and could be run faster on the host, it may
still be more efficient to execute them on the device if this means eliding intermediate copies.
Ideally, all the data needed by an application would be transferred once and kept on device
memory at all times, but this may not always be possible due to device memory size limitations.
Thus, reducing the total memory footprint of an application becomes a very important
optimization target.

Similar considerations apply to supercomputing clusters such as the Summit<sup>[6]</sup> machine at Oak
Ridge - at the time of this writing, number 2 on the top 500 list of the world’s fastest
supercomputers. While Summit has over 10 Petabytes of total system memory, it only has a bit
over 400 Terabytes of device memory - considerably less than the total system memory
available on previous-generation supercomputers like NERSC’s Cori<sup>[7]</sup>. Thus, if you are running
in a mode where your entire problem fits on the device at all times - desirable given the
aforementioned expense of host-device transfers - it is difficult to run as large a problem on
Summit as you could on Cori. This further highlights the importance of reducing the overall
memory footprint of your application.

### Memory allocation on the device
Leveraging device memory to store temporary data structures is advantageous to reduce
host/device data transfers. However, memory allocation is much slower on the device than on
the host and should be used with care. In particular, frequent allocations of small chunks of
memory negatively impact performance and should be avoided by using memory “arenas”
instead. A memory arena is a large continuous share of memory that is created/destroyed all at
once, oftentimes at the beginning/end of program execution. Arenas are typically managed by
specialized classes that handle the allocation/deallocation process and dispatch chunks of it to
other objects for use as storage as requested by the program. When these objects are
destroyed, the arena marks the associated chunk of memory as free without any deallocation
involved. The advantage is that device memory is reused and calls to system allocation functions
are minimized. In this way, dynamic data structures can be used without incurring prohibitive
memory allocation costs.

### Consider the roofline
As with CPU functions, GPU kernel performance can be either compute bound, meaning limited
by the number of floating point operations per second the accelerator hardware can perform, or
memory bound, meaning limited by the rate at which can be streamed to the multiprocessors
either from main memory or from various levels of the cache hierarchy. The roofline model<sup>[8]</sup> is a
method for visually reasoning about the way these factors limit the performance of
computational kernels. By virtue of the GPUs impressive floating-point performance, it is
common for GPU kernels in scientific codes to be memory-bound. Consequently, it is often
faster to recompute intermediate results than save them for other kernels to use. This may help
reduce the number of allocations on device memory and the total memory footprint on the
application.

Note that the roofline model does not factor in latency, a measure of how long a processor takes
after starting an instruction for the result to be ready to be used by another instruction. CPUs
use sophisticated branch prediction and speculative fetching to minimize latency, whereas
GPUs use massive parallelism to maximize throughput. As a result, the roofline model tends to
be a better guide for GPU codes than CPU codes; however, it can still be a useful way to think
about some GPU kernels.

### Conclusion
GPU computing offers remarkable potential for speeding up many scientific workloads. Even if
code modifications are usually necessary to evade the performance bottlenecks outlined above,
exceptional speed ups are possible.
