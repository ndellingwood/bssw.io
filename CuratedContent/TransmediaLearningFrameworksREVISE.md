### Using Resources and Technology to Optimize Your Productivity

This [webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ssh8VDj6Nro) explains key points of self-directed online learning, including how to develop a transmedia learning framework (TLF) leveraging massively open online courses (MOOC), podcasts, social media, videos, practice environments, and more. The webinar is based on material presented in a tutorial at the [2nd Annual ECP Annual Meeting](https://www.ecpannualmeeting.com).  The tutorial features a walk-through of relevant learning applications organized in a transmedia learning framework (TLF). Take-away practical strategies, resources, and tools that can be applied toward learning more productively are also provided.

Additionally, this related [on-demand learning blog post](https://bssw.io/blog_posts/on-demand-learning-for-better-scientific-software-how-to-use-resources-technology-to-optimize-your-productivity) provides answers to questions from the webinar's participants about challenges associated with learning in the wild (i.e., as it naturally occurs in a social context).
